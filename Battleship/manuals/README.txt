Battleship Application
Author: Aaron Zachariah
Operating System: Windows 8.1
Tested using Java version 1.8.0_331


RUNNING THE APPLICATION:
To start the application, you must run the "start" script. There will be two versions, one is a cmd script an one is a bash script.
Make sure to run the correct script for your Operating system.

Simply open the terminal, navigate to the scripts folder and run the correct script. Double-clicking the script
directly from the folder may also work. The application will prompt the user to either host a game or connect to one, and will
subsequently ask the user to input the network configuration.

Please refer to manual.pdf to see how to connect/host a game and how to format the input.

The extra "bin" directory is used to hold generated class files.
